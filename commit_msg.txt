refactor: modernize character stats and implement runtime battle initialization

- Rename 'str' to 'atk' across schemas, locales, and character data for consistency.
- Update CharacterSchema to include optional battle runtime properties (currentHp, statusEffects, etc.).
- Enhance BattleStore to support initializing units with pre-defined health and status effects.
- Add 'Wounded Scout' enemy to demonstrate initial debuffs and partial health spawning.
- Remove unused stacking fields from StatusSchema and clean up special status data.
- Update UI components to use consistent stat keys (mag, spd).
